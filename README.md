Short listing names and Binary tree scripts

# Task#1: Binary Tree Traversal
As I understood, Traverse a userdefined or sample binary tree inorder (leftmost, root finally right child)
  Approach:
  -tree is traversed inorder with LeftChildSort() function. Only LeftChildSort() & buildTree() are allowed in main  
   function.
  -Both a sample Tree and a user-input tree are allowed.
  
# Task#2: Short List names
As I understood that day, a function that sorts names in array, any new name if contains alphabets that are in the names stored earlier are dynamically omitted, but new names with any unique alphabet are shortlisted
  Approach:
  -Using vector class, for dynamic string array allocation.  
  -Option to collect user-input allowed along with sample data.
  -Two different ways are included for sorting, both yield same result
